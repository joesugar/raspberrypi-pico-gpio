This repository is set up with a different project on each branch.

There are currently three branches, each of which correspond to the following projects: 

* __gpio-write__        - Simple project showing how to configure and write to a GPIO pin
* __gpio-read-write__   - Simple project showing how to configure and read/write to a GPIO pin.
* __gpio-irq__          - Simple project showing how to use an IRQ and callback on a GPIO pin.

To access a specific project, checkout the corresponding branch.

The projects will be updated and additional notes added as needed and acquired.
