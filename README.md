This repository is set up with a different project on each branch.

There are currently three branches, each of which correspond to the following projects: 

gpio-write        Simple project showing how to configure and write to a GPIO pin
gpio-read-write   Simple project showing how to configure and read/write to a GPIO pin.
gpio-irq          Simple project showing how to use an IRQ and callback on a GPIO pin.

To access a specific project, checkout the corresponding branch.

The projects will be updated and added to as new notes are needed and acquired.
